how words can be found:

for each word, we want to check in each of these 6 ways
if the word is not found, we return (0,0)

frontwards horizontal:
the first letter is at the FRONT of the sequence
starts with (i,j) and ends with (i,j+(n-1)) where n is the length of the word

backwards horizontal:
the first letter is at the END of the sequence 
starts with (i,j) and ends with (i,j-(n-1)) where n is the length of the word

frontwards vertical:
the first letter is on the FRONT of the sequence 
starts with (i,j) and ends with (i+(n-1),j) where n is the length of the word

backwards vertical:
starts with (i,j) and ends with (i,j-(n-1)) where n is the length of the word

frontwards diagonal:
starts with (i,j) and ends with (i+(n-1),j+(n-1)) where n is the length of the word

backwards diagonal:
starts with (i,j) and ends with (i-(n-1),j-(n-1)) where n is the length of the word
