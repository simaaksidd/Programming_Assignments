# Let's do A4 notes now 

# how to determine if a cube is in a sphere
# if all 8 points of a cube are inside the sphere then its in the sphere

# determine if a sphere instersects another sphere
# if a sphere is not strictly inside and not strictly outside then it intersects

# determine if a point is a cube
# if point x is strictly between xmax and xmin, 
# if point y is strictly between ymax and ymin
# if point z is strictly between zmax and zmin 

# determine if a cube intersects a cube
# if a cube is not strictly inside and not strictly outside then it intersects

# most of these are finding the max and min x,y,z values to find the
